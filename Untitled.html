  <div>What is reality? “Obviously, no one can say because it isn’t words.”  The question posed by one of the most prominent British philosophers continues to remain relevant as the world transitions into virtual reality. To say virtual is not to imply a fictitious world. Instead, a quasi-state universe, where real-world concepts exist, acted out digitally through micro-display illuminating holographic images.  Researchers from various fields recognize Metaverse as a fully immersive world, a universe that embodies an economy, social order, and legislation.  Yet, it is these attributes that call into question whether the interrelationship between the physical and virtual world warrants enforcement.  Momentarily, consider the central role that financial institution has on economic stability; in fact, we have seen the effects of what occurs when financial institutions are given leverage.  What if the virtual economy in Metaverse could have the exact aftereffect?
